## Overview:

In this third practical application assignment, the goal is to compare the performance of different classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) using a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

## Data:

The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository. It consists of data from a Portuguese banking institution and includes the results of multiple marketing campaigns. Additional information on the data and features can be found in the accompanying article within the .zip file provided.

## Conclusion

Through exploratory data analysis and the application of various algorithms, we gained valuable insights into the telemarketing dataset and developed a highly accurate predictive model.

We compared the following classifiers:

	•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
	•	Logistic Regression Classifier
	•	Decision Tree Classifier
	•	Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

Based on the evaluation results and specific requirements, we can choose the classifier that best meets your needs in terms of performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

From the evaluated classifiers, the SVM and Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy scores, around 91%. The SVM classifier, especially after hyperparameter tuning, performed well. The Decision Tree Classifier had relatively lower accuracy but provided insights into feature importance. The KNN classifier had the lowest accuracy among the three.

If identifying key factors and interpretability are important, the Decision Tree is a good choice due to its clear tree structure representation of the decision-making process. Additionally, for computational efficiency, the Decision Tree is beneficial due to its low training time.

This analysis demonstrates the application of various machine learning models to predict term deposit subscription based on client features and marketing campaign details. By leveraging these predictive models, the bank can optimize its marketing efforts and resource allocation, ultimately improving efficiency and effectiveness in acquiring term deposits.
